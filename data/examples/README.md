Example scenarios
=================

This module contains example scenarios for the simulator.
Each scenario consists of:

- A configuration (YAML)
- Optionally, one or more python scripts and/or jupyter notebooks to drive the simulation and explore the results.

Note: by default the paths for `.so` models and the simulator point to the build directory.

Instructions
------------

~~bash
./run-sim.sh
~~~

Follow instructions from python scripts/jupyter notebooks.
